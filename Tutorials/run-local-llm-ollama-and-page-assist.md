# LLM, Just for You: A Practical Tutorial to Run a Local Model

## Introduction (***Sorry for the long intro***)

This tutorial is designed for individuals seeking greater control and transparency in their data processing, regardless of their background or expertise. I will provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up a local LLM environment using Ollama as the backend and Page Assist extension in your browser.

ðŸ”´ **The Privacy and security issue of Cloud based LLM services**

Using Large Language Model (LLM) services online can raise significant privacy concerns. When you rely on cloud-based LLMs, your data is stored and processed by third-party providers, which can lead to unintended consequences. Your input data may be shared with other users or used for purposes beyond what you initially intended. Additionally, the algorithms used to train these models are often complex and opaque, making it difficult to understand how your data is being processed and potentially leading to biased or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, the sheer scale of cloud-based LLMs means that even minor issues can result in massive data breaches, compromising the privacy and security of countless users

ðŸŸ¢ **Control in Your Hands: Advantagesof Running LLM Models Locally**

Running Large Language Model (LLM) models locally offers several advantages, particularly in terms of privacy and control. By processing data on your own machine, you can ensure that your input data remains confidential and is not shared with third-party providers. This also allows you to maintain complete control over the model's training and deployment, ensuring that it aligns with your specific goals and objectives. Additionally, running LLM models locally enables faster processing times and reduced latency, making it ideal for applications where real-time feedback is essential. Furthermore, by keeping your data and model on-premises, you can avoid potential issues related to data sovereignty, such as data localization requirements and regulatory compliance.

# Integrating AI Models into Your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (IN PROGRESS)

## Introduction

## Cursor.sh , the dedicated IDE for seamless AI integration

[Cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-driven code editor designed to assist developers in writing code more efficiently and quickly. It leverages LLM like **GPT-4** to provide a unique set of features and functionalities, making it a prominent competitor in the coding tool market.

Some key features of Cursor.sh include:

* **Code understanding and context**: Cursor.sh can ***understand the context of your entire codebase***, allowing it to provide tailored suggestions, generate unit tests, and even implement new features by modifying the relevant files.
* **Natural language editing**: You can edit code using natural language prompts, such as changing an entire method or class with a single instruction.
* **Code generation**: Cursor.sh can generate code from scratch based on simple instructions provided by the user.
* **Copilot++**: An enhanced version of GitHub Copilot that can suggest mid-line completions and entire diffs, trained to autocomplete based on sequences of edits.
* **Integration with VSCode**: Cursor.sh is ***a fork of VSCode***, allowing users to import all their extensions, themes, and keybindings with a single click.
* **Privacy options**: Cursor.sh ***offers a privacy mode*** where none of your code is stored on their servers or logs, catering to security-critical work.

Cursor.sh has received **positive reviews from developers**, with many praising its ability to save time and increase productivity by reducing the need for manual coding and code navigation. However, some users have reported **compatibility issues** with certain ***VSCode extensions or versions***, which may impact the support for specific languages or frameworks.

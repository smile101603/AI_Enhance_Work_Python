## Introduction

üü¢ ***Employing AI-powered tools can yield significant benefits for your work tasks, including***:

* **Automating repetitive and mundane tasks**: By delegating routine chores to AI systems, you gain valuable time to focus on more strategic initiatives.
* **Delivering data-driven insights**: Utilize analytics provided by AI tools to make informed decisions and drive optimal results.
* **Optimizing workflows and processes**: Enhance productivity and efficiency with streamlined operations powered by AI technologies.
* **Creating an engaging and intuitive workspace**: Foster a more personalized, enjoyable, and intellectually stimulating environment through AI implementations.

üî¥ ***However, potential downsides should be considered***:

* **Dependence on AI may undermine human skills**: Overreliance on AI systems could lead to diminished problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and creativity.
* **Potential errors or biased outcomes**: AI systems can occasionally produce inaccuracies or generate prejudiced results, which might negatively impact decision-making processes and outcomes.
* **Risks to privacy and security**: AI usage may introduce vulnerabilities related to the processing, storage, and sharing of sensitive data, potentially resulting in breaches or unauthorized access.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Balancing the benefits of AI with an awareness of these potential drawbacks is crucial. Taking appropriate measures to mitigate risks is essential for successful integration into workflows.**
>
> To effectively mitigate risks associated with generative AI technologies, it's essential to have a solid understanding of their fundamentals. By educating yourself, you'll be better equipped to identify and correct errors and biases, ensuring more accurate and reliable results.

## Automation

### Autonomous Agents

AI agents are intelligent software entities that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously on behalf of a user or system. These agents can adapt to new situations, and communicate with other agents or systems to achieve their goals.

## Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are sophisticated AI systems trained on enormous datasets of text to craft human-like language, capable of comprehending and generating natural language forms.

üîµ ***Helpful definition for this Section***

When referring to a Model , we use the following terms :

- ***Elo Score*** : A dynamic score that estimates the strength and capabilities of a large language model based on its performance.
- ***Context Window*** : Maximum number of tokens the model can process and consider simultaneously when generating responses. Learn about [Context Windows](https://research.ibm.com/blog/larger-context-window) from IBM.
- ***Knowledge Cutoff*** : A specific point in time, after which new information or updates are no longer incorporated into the model's training data. This can help to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model remains accurate and relevant over time.

### Generalist LLMs

> [!Tip]
>  check out our **[tutorial](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/run-local-llm-ollama-and-page-assist.md)** to set up a local LLM environment with Ollama and the Page Assist extension, and take back the control over your data.
>
> Running models locally gives you complete control over your data, ensuring both its **security and privacy.** This means your information isn't shared with external servers or third parties, safeguarding it from potential breaches or misuse.

> [!NOTE]
> The models are ranked according to their Elo scores (with higher scores indicating better performance) from the [LMSys Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard). Please note that **Elo scores are subject to change** based on user votes and will be updated regularly to reflect the latest rankings.

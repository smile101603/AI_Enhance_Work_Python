## Introduction

üü¢ ***Employing AI-powered tools can yield significant benefits for your work tasks, including***:

* **Automating repetitive and mundane tasks**: By delegating routine chores to AI systems, you gain valuable time to focus on more strategic initiatives.
* **Delivering data-driven insights**: Utilize analytics provided by AI tools to make informed decisions and drive optimal results.
* **Optimizing workflows and processes**: Enhance productivity and efficiency with streamlined operations powered by AI technologies.
* **Creating an engaging and intuitive workspace**: Foster a more personalized, enjoyable, and intellectually stimulating environment through AI implementations.

üî¥ ***However, potential downsides should be considered***:

* **Dependence on AI may undermine human skills**: Overreliance on AI systems could lead to diminished problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and creativity.
* **Potential errors or biased outcomes**: AI systems can occasionally produce inaccuracies or generate prejudiced results, which might negatively impact decision-making processes and outcomes.
* **Risks to privacy and security**: AI usage may introduce vulnerabilities related to the processing, storage, and sharing of sensitive data, potentially resulting in breaches or unauthorized access.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Balancing the benefits of AI with an awareness of these potential drawbacks is crucial. Taking appropriate measures to mitigate risks is essential for successful integration into workflows.**
>
> To effectively mitigate risks associated with generative AI technologies, it's essential to have a solid understanding of their fundamentals. By educating yourself, you'll be better equipped to identify and correct errors and biases, ensuring more accurate and reliable results.
> Microsoft offers [helpful lessons](https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/#/) on this subject that can provide you with valuable knowledge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository now features a new section dedicated solely to **tutorials**. In this section, I will provide detailed guides aimed at enhancing specific uses of these AI tools.**
>
> * Learn to set up a local LLM chatbot with our first tutorial, "[A Practical Tutorial to Run a Local Model](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/run-local-llm-ollama-and-page-assist.md)", and address privacy concerns of cloud-based AI tools.
> * Learn to set up your IDE to integrate your preferred AI provider with this second tutorial, "[Integrating AI Models into Your Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/integrating-ai-models-into-ide.md), and enhance your overall coding experience.

## AI Agents

AI agents are intelligent software entities that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously on behalf of a user or system. These agents can learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and communicate with other agents or systems to achieve their goals.

### Autonomous Agents

### Language Models for Function Calling

Function Calling allows language models to interact with external functions or APIs within conversations. It generates JSON objects with function names and arguments, enabling actions like querying databases, sending emails, or making API calls based on conversation context. This expands capabilities beyond text responses, allowing dynamic and reactive interactions.

| Tool                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                            | Licence       | Pricing    |
|:--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------:|:----------:|
| [Octopus-V2](https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/Octopus-v2) | An open-source language model with 2B parameters, developed by Nexa AI for Android API function calling, representing a research breakthrough in LLM application | Open        | Free |

> [!Note]
> Do not confond Function Calling with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) which is a technique that retrieves relevant information from a database and injects it into the language model's context, allowing the model to focus on what is most relevant for a given query.
> 
> RAG augments the model's knowledge, while function calling augments its capabilities and actions.

## Automation

### Autonomous Agents

AI agents are intelligent software entities that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously on behalf of a user or system. These agents can adapt to new situations, and communicate with other agents or systems to achieve their goals.

### Video Generation

> [!NOTE]
> As video generation models are still in their early stages of development, primarily driven by large companies like OpenAI with Sora or Runway with Gen3, we have limited information on how each model functions.
>
> For now, we can only offer a limited selection of open-source models available on Hugging Face.

#### Image to Video Models

An image-to-video AI model is a sophisticated machine learning system designed to generate short video clips from a single input image.

### Vision Language Models

Vision language models (VLMs) are **AI models that combine computer vision and natural language processing capabilities** to understand and process both images and text together. Learn more on [Huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms).

Take control of your data and models - all Open-source models in this list can be run locally, with our **[How to run LLMs locally on your machine](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/run-llms-locally-on-your-machine.md)***.

> [!NOTE]
> The models are ranked according to their **Overall score** (with higher scores indicating better performance) from multiple benchmarks.
>
>  This benchmark use different method to evaluate various VLMs capabilities, later used to calculate the Overall score. However, **the top-ranked model might not be number one in all specific capacities.**

When referring to a Model , we use the following terms :

- ***Context Window*** : Maximum number of tokens the model can process and consider simultaneously when generating responses. Learn about [Context Windows](https://research.ibm.com/blog/larger-context-window) from IBM.
- ***Knowledge Cutoff*** : A specific point in time, after which new information or updates are no longer incorporated into the model's training data. This can help to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model remains accurate and relevant over time.

### Generalist LLMs

> [!Tip]
>  check out our **[tutorial](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/run-llms-locally-on-your-machine.md)** to set up a local LLM environment with Ollama and the Page Assist extension, and take back the control over your data.
>
> Running models locally gives you complete control over your data, ensuring both its **security and privacy.** This means your information isn't shared with external servers or third parties, safeguarding it from potential breaches or misuse.

> [!NOTE]
> The models are ranked according to their **Quality Index (with higher scores indicating better performance)** from the [Artificial Analysis LLM Leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/o1?models_selected=o1%2Co1-mini%2Cgpt-4o-2024-08-06%2Cgpt-4o-mini%2Cgemini-1-5-pro%2Cgemini-1-5-flash%2Cclaude-35-sonnet%2Cclaude-3-opus%2Cclaude-3-haiku%2Creka-core%2Cdeepseek-v2-5%2Cyi-large%2Cclaude-3-sonnet). Please note that **Quality Index is subject to change** based on daily test-run and will be updated regularly to reflect the latest rankings. I consider this **benchmarking methodology to be less biased** than the Elo score method employed by LMSys. Furthermore, the **LMSys leaderboard does not address datasets contamination , model quantization and model overfitting issues.**
>
> Please note that **Artifical Analysis do not benchmark all the models** available in the market. For reference, we offer an estimated score based on various other benchmarks, denoted by ***None (~estimated score)***.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Having trouble choosing a model ?** We are here to help you make an informed decision. [This dedicated section](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/run-llms-locally-on-your-machine.md#find-the-model-that-is-right-for-you) provides a comprehensive overview of **the best open-source and Proprietary models**, along with ***estimated performance metric.***

### Coding LLMs

> [!Tip]
> check out our **[tutorial](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/integrating-ai-models-into-ide.md)** to integrate Cloud-based AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Groq, or local model providers such as ollama, **directly into your coding environment**.

#### Coding Open Source Models

> [!NOTE]
> The models are ranked according to **LiveCodeBench Pass@1 Code Generation scores** (with higher scores indicating better performance). Pass@1 is the probability of passing a given problem in one attempt. [LiveCodeBench](https://livecodebench.github.io/leaderboard.html) offers a more comprehensive, up-to-date, and contamination-aware evaluation of code-related capabilities compared to HumanEval.
>
> Please note that non-specialized models may perform better than the specialized ones described below. To see the Pass@1 scores for all major models, please refer to the [dedicated tables](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/integrating-ai-models-into-ide.md#models-for-coding).
